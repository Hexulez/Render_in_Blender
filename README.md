# Render_in_Blender

Tool to render files at night :) <br/>
<br/>
First time:<br/>
When you first time start app, it will ask blender.exe file location write or copy file path without file name. and program will save it to environment variables. <br/>
if not working try run manually blender_path.bat file what coming program folder after first run.<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
You can also go to environment variable menu and add manually to path variable blender.exe location.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Usage:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Open render_in_blender.exe file. choose one file to open and repeat every file you want to render. After you open every file, you want to render, click cancel and program start calling blender to render files one by one.<br/>
<br/>
Bug:<br/>
File names or path names cannot include any space. any space in names make error.<br/>
sometimes program does not add environment variable try remove blender_path.bat file or add manually blender command with environment variable.<br/>
